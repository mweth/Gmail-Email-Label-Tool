# ðŸ“§ Email Organizer for Gmail

Organize your Gmail inbox effectively and never miss an important email! The primary aim of this tool is to help you identify emails that are **exclusively sent to you** within your organization, ensuring they stand out from the clutter. By doing so, the tool helps users separate the human-sent, direct emails from transactional or promotional emails.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Human-Sent, Direct Email Highlighting:** Recognizes emails sent by a human directly to you within the organization, and labels them for prominence.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Uses Gmail's native functions and the Gmail API for in-depth email inspection.
- **Configurable Exclusions:** Exclude emails based on content, sender, or other criteria to further refine your inbox.
- **Automatic Labeling:** Emails that fulfill the criteria are automatically labeled.

## ðŸ“‚ How the Filter Works

1. **Return-Path Check:** Emails are first inspected for a match between the 'From' address and the 'Return-Path'. Mismatches often hint at promotional or bulk emails.
2. **Domain Focus:** The tool focuses on emails sent from within your domain. If you're the sole recipient, it's highlighted. Otherwise, different labels can be applied based on your configuration.
3. **Content Inspection:** Emails containing specified phrases (like "unsubscribe", "privacy policy", etc.) are excluded.
4. **Recipient Verification:** If an email has recipients from your domain other than you, it's labeled accordingly.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Script Implementation:** 
   - Initiate a new Google Apps Script project.
   - Paste the provided script into this project.

   - Incorporate the required scopes to your `appsscript.json`.
   - A comprehensive guide is available [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced).

3. **Script Execution:**
   - Run the `setup()` function within the Apps Script editor. This establishes the necessary triggers.
   - Post this, the script will autonomously function at pre-set intervals, organizing your emails.

4. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - For a more personalized experience, adjust labels, filter words, and more by modifying the configuration constants.
