# ðŸ“§ Gmail Spotlight

If you use Gmail and get asked to "dig through your inbox" for a lost email, this tool's for you.
"Spotlight" flags emails sent just to you by an actual person.  It is designed to catch those one-off emails that frequently fall through the cracks.  If opposing counsel turns a large group email into a 1:1 chat, it'll flag it. If someone from your work sends an email only to you, it flags that too. Even if it's an email to you and a hundred others, if you are the only person at your office to receive it, Spotlight will catch it.

What it won't flag? Ads, receipts, or group emails with other coworkers.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Human-Sent, Direct Email Highlighting:** Recognizes emails sent by a human directly to you within the organization, and labels them for prominence.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Uses Gmail's native functions and the Gmail API for in-depth email inspection.
- **Configurable Exclusions:** Exclude emails based on content, sender, or other criteria to further refine your inbox.
- **Automatic Labeling:** Emails that fulfill the criteria are automatically labeled.

## ðŸ“‚ How the Filter Works

1. **Return-Path Check:** Emails are first inspected for a match between the 'From' address and the 'Return-Path'. Mismatches often hint at promotional or bulk emails.
2. **Domain Focus:** The tool helps you avoid missing an important internal email sent solely to you. If you're the sole recipient of an internal email, it's highlighted. Otherwise, different labels can be applied based on your configuration.
3. **Content Inspection:** Emails containing specified phrases (like "unsubscribe", "privacy policy", etc.) are excluded.
4. **Recipient Verification:** If an email has recipients from your domain other than you, it's labeled accordingly.

## ðŸ“Œ Examples

1. An email sent from John@**X**.com to Me@**here**.com will be flagged. ðŸ“Œ
